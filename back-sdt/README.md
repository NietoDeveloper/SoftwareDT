⚙️ Software DT | Backend & API Infrastructure🚀 Enterprise-Grade Node.js Engineering by NietoDeveloperThis is the robust RESTful API core of Software DT. Engineered in Bogotá, this backend leverages a highly modular architecture designed for high availability, secure identity management, and multi-database synchronization.📈 Technical Momentum & LeadershipDaily Excellence: Built under a strict philosophy of constant optimization—140+ consecutive days of commits.Top Ranking: Developed by NietoDeveloper, currently #3 Top Committer in Colombia (Targeting #1 by Q1 2026).Reliability: Production-ready architecture currently powering active client ecosystems.📂 Backend Architecture MapThe server is organized following the Separation of Concerns principle to ensure the API remains maintainable as it scales:Plaintextserver/

Double Cluster SynchronizationUnlike standard setups, this API manages a Dual Connection Logic (userDB and citaDB). The server uses a synchronized startup sequence (Promise.all) ensuring that both high-availability clusters are active before accepting traffic, providing superior data isolation.🔐 2. Hybrid Access Control MiddlewareThe architecture implements a sophisticated three-tier security layer:Public Access: Standard endpoints for registration and authentication.Optional Access: Context-aware routes (optionalAccess) that adapt based on the presence of credentials.Protected Core: A global verifyAccess (JWT) barrier that shields private user and doctor updates.🛡️ 3. Error Handling & StabilityCentralized Error Handler: A dedicated middleware to standardize API responses during failures.Graceful Shutdown:
